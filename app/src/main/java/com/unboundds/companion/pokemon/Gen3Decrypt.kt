/**
 * Reads species/item/experience/moves/nickname/OT-name from a party Pokemon
 * struct at 0x02024284 in Pokemon Unbound.
 *
 * This is NOT standard Gen 3 encryption. Vanilla FireRed encrypts+shuffles the
 * 48-byte substructure block at 0x20-0x4F (personality-dependent order, XOR key
 * = personality^otId). We implemented that in full, verified the shuffle table
 * against PKHeX's real source, and it STILL produced garbage species/moves.
 *
 * Root cause, confirmed on real hardware 2026-07-22: species at raw offset 0x20
 * (no decryption, no reordering) is correct for every party member regardless
 * of personality value. CFRU (Unbound's engine base) has its own `struct
 * Pokemon` type for the live in-RAM party -- distinct from the save-file
 * `struct BoxPokemon` -- with species/item/experience/moves/pp stored in
 * PLAINTEXT at the classic fixed offsets (Growth always at 0x20, Attacks
 * always at 0x2C, etc), never encrypted or shuffled. Our "decryption" was
 * corrupting already-plain data by XORing it with a key that doesn't apply
 * here. This file just reads the fields directly.
